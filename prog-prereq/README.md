Moosader.com Programming Prerequisites
======================================

What is this?
-------------

This repo consists of a series of "Programming Assignments" based on my
tutorial, ![Game Programming Prerequisites](http://www.moosader.com/resources/tutorials/game-programming-prerequisite-test/1).
Basically, it's a series of assignments to test your C++ skills for you to find out
if you're ready to begin programming games with a library.

I am also writing my own submissions, both for fun and for reference.

I meant for each assignment to only contain topics from that section, plus
anything prior, but not in the future assignments.  Therefore, for the
assignments on something like "Functions", I will not include "Classes", as
that is a later topic.
A lot of people will just write the programs normally, though.

Cheating
--------

Try these assignments on your own FIRST!  Post them to the Moosader message board,
get critiquing. Don't just read somebody else's code and copy it, you won't be learning anything
that way!
