/*
 * Game Programming: Prerequisite Tests
 * Assignment 1, Test 1
 * Write a C++ program that displays a short story, a couple paragraphs long. There should be new-lines in this program, but you can choose the best way to do this.
 * 
 * I had intended for these assignments to only include concepts from this assignment
 * and all previous, but not future ones (ie, not classes in the "Conditional Statements" test)
